A trapdoor function is a function which you cannot undo unless you know the used parameters (keys). In this case, knowing the two Primes which define N is the trapdoor. Examples for such functions include:

## 1 Discrete Logarithm Problem
- [[Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange]]

## 2 Elliptic Curve
- [[Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellmann Ephemeral (ECDHE)]]

## 3 Factorization Problem
- [[RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)]]
